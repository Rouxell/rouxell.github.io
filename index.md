A.L. Rouxell is the pen name of a mother-and-son writing team who share a passion for storytelling. 
			
The mother, originally from China, moved to North America to pursue doctoral studies in mathematics and later earned her Ph.D. With a background in scientific research, she possesses a natural curiosity and a deep love for literature. Her transition from academic writing to creative storytelling reflects their shared diverse interests—from problem-solving 
and cross-genre reading to exploring the wonders of ancient myths.
					
The son, a spirited and imaginative storyteller, provides fresh perspectives that shape the narrative. A lover of fantasy and mythology, he balances his creativity with a rigorous academic schedule. Fluent in English, French, and Chinese, he enjoys video games, solving puzzles, spending time with friends, and exploring new ideas.
			
United by a love of reading, writing, puzzle-solving, and an insatiable curiosity about the world, they brought to life "The Sacred Tree: The Young, The Beast, and The Masters", the first book in a fantasy series that blends ancient Chinese mythology with mystery and adventure. this book as a fun experiment—part creative challenge, part friendly competition. Stealing moments between equations and exams, they kept returning to the story, drawn in by its magic, until it became something they truly loved.
					
Their second project honors another storyteller: after discovering Jin Shijiu’s writings online, they were inspired to practice acupuncture themselves. They adapted, translated, and expanded his work, hoping to share his legacy with new readers.
