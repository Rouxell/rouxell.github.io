A.L. Rouxell is the pen name of two authors—a parent and their young co-creator—who share a passion for storytelling. Together, they brought to life Journey to 琅玕 (Tree of Life), the first book in the “Journey to…” series, blending ancient Chinese mythology with mystery and adventure.

One author, originally from China, moved to North America to pursue doctoral studies in mathematics and later earned their Ph.D. With a background in scientific research, they possess a natural curiosity and a deep love for literature. The transition from academic writing to creative storytelling reflects their diverse interests, including problem-solving, reading across genres, and exploring the wonders of ancient myths.

The other author, a spirited and imaginative storyteller, provides fresh perspectives that shape the narrative. A lover of fantasy and mythology, they showcase their ability to immerse themselves in creativity amid a rigorous and busy academic schedule. Fluent in English, French, and Chinese, they also enjoy video games, solving puzzles, spending time with friends, and exploring new ideas.

Together, the duo combines their unique strengths to create a world where ancient myths intertwine with modern storytelling, inviting readers on an unforgettable world through Journey to 琅玕 (Tree of Life).
